# Hello, I am Ilija DomisloviÄ‡
I am a student at the University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science.
Am currently at the final stage with my defense hopefully being in June of 2023.

The main focus of my doctoral research is computer vision and machine learning, more specifically color constancy. 
Generally, the area of machine learning interests me and I want to expand my knowledge and continue exploring the capabilities of machine learning.

I created this site[^1] to give a more detailed description of the research I have done for my doctoral thesis.

## Research


A summary of my doctoral thesis can be found [here](./thesis_summary.html).

Here are the 5 papers I have published in pursuit of my doctorate.
You can click on the links to get a detailed description of the research.

* [One-net: Convolutional color constancy simplified](./one_net.html)
* [Outdoor daytime multi-illuminant color constancy](./ispa.html)
* [Shadows & Lumination: Two-illuminant multiple cameras color constancy dataset](./shal.html)
* [Filters & Lumination: Creating multi-illuminant images for computational color constancy](./filters.html)
* [Color constancy for non-uniform illumination estimation with variable number of illuminants](./zane.html)

## Embedded programming


In addition to computer vision, I Have an interest in the field of embedded programming where I have done several projects.

* The creation of a smart plug that tracks user energy consumption and stores the data on a local server
* The development of a device used in fuel trucks to monitor whether the fuel latch is open. This included the development of the embedded hardware, embedded software, and component testing.
* The creation of a functional camera system on an FPGA board. This included the creation of a driver form camera sensor and FPGA communication, RAW to JPEG decoding, and image storing.
