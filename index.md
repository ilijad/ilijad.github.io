# Hello, I am Ilija DomisloviÄ‡
I am currently working as a Software Engineer at dSPACE.
I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, in September of 2023.

The main focus of my doctoral research was computer vision and machine learning, more specifically color constancy. 
Generally, the area of machine learning interests me and I want to expand my knowledge and continue exploring the capabilities of machine learning.
In addition to machine learning, I have an interest in embedded programming.

I created this site[^1] to give a more detailed description of the research I have done for my doctoral thesis.

## Embedded programming


In addition to computer vision, I Have an interest in the field of embedded programming where I have done several projects.

* The creation of a smart plug that tracks user energy consumption and stores the data on a local server
* The development of a device used in fuel trucks to monitor whether the fuel latch is open. This included the development of the embedded hardware, embedded software, and component testing.
* The creation of a functional camera system on an FPGA board. This included the creation of a driver form camera sensor and FPGA communication, RAW to JPEG decoding, and image storing.
