# Hello there, I am Ilija DomisloviÄ‡
I am a student at University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science.
Am currently at the final stage with my defence hopefully being in June of 2023.

The main focus of my doctoral reseach is computer vision and machine learning, more specifically color constancy. 
Generally the area of machine learning interests me and I want to expand my knowledge and continue exploring the capabiliets machine learning.

I created this site to give a more detailed description of the research I have done for my doctoral thesis.

## Color constancy

Color constancy is an example of subjective constancy and a feature of the human color perception system which ensures that the perceived color of objects remains relatively constant under varying illumination conditions. A green apple for instance looks green to us at midday, when the main illumination is white sunlight, and also at sunset, when the main illumination is red. This helps us identify objects.

## Additional interests


In addition to computer vision I Have an interest in the field of embedded programing where I have done several projects.

* The creation of a smart plug that track user energy consumption and store the data on a local server
* The development of a device used in fuel trucks to monitor whether the fuel latch is open. This incuded the development of the enbede hardware, embeded software and component testing.
* The creation of a function camera system on a FPGA board. This incuded the creaetion of a driver form camera sensor and FPGA comunication, RAW to JPEG decoding and image storing.
