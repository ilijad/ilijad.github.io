Ilija DomisloviÄ‡
Young researcher at University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing

About

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at dSPACE. I completed my Ph.D. at the
University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, in September of 2023.
My main interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and embedded programming.

Doctoral reseach:

This website was made to serve as an archive of the research I have done for color constancy.

Color constancy is an example of subjective constancy and a feature of the human color perception system 
which ensures that the perceived color of objects remains relatively constant under varying illumination conditions. 
A green apple for instance looks green to us at midday, when the main illumination is white sunlight, and also at sunset, 
when the main illumination is red. This helps us identify objects. 

Taken from wikipedia

Here are the 5 papers I have publihsed in pursuit of my doctorate.
You can click on the links to get a detailed description of the research.

1. One-net: Convolutional color constancy simplified
2. Outdoor daytime multi-illuminant color constancy
3. Shadows & Lumination: Two-illuminant multiple cameras color constancy dataset
4. Filters & Lumination: Creating multi-illuminant images for computational color constancy
5. Color constancy for non-uniform illumination estimation with variable number of illuminants


In addition to computer vision I Have an interest in the field of embedded programing where I have done several projects.
These include:
The creation of a smart plug that track user energy consumption and store the data on a local server
The development of a device used in fuel trucks to monitor whether the fuel latch is open. This incuded the development of the enbede hardware, embeded software and component testing.
The creation of a function camera system on a FPGA board. This incuded the creaetion of a driver form camera sensor and FPGA comunication, RAW to JPEG decoding and image storing.
